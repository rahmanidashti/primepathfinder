# Prime Path Finder
Prime Path Finder in C

## Description
This is an implementation of _Prime Path Finder_ algorithm based on the Alg. 1 in [2]. The authors of paper proposed a prime path finder that is a extention of prime path procedure in [1] (see _chapter 2, subsection 2.2.1, paeg 36_).

## Implementation

## Example
As an exampple, we created the follwong graph in the [sample.gr](https://github.com/rahmanidashti/primepathfinder/blob/master/dataset/sample.gr) and ran it.

The follwoing figure, show the result of prime pathes in the example (there are 10 prime pathes):

## Compile and Run
First you must compile the source code by `gcc primePathFinder.c -o prime`, then you can run it by `./prime`.
